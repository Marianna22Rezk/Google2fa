# Simple Netflix Clone Skeleton

This folder contains a minimal Flask application demonstrating how a video streaming service could be structured.

Features:

- User login with Google Authenticator 2FA (same as the example in `../app`).
- Listing available videos from `static/videos`.
- Streaming individual video files.

This is only a small demonstration and does not replicate the full Netflix platform.
